# Image Recognition for Quality Control

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an image recognition system to identify defects in products on a production line. By automating the defect detection process, businesses can ensure higher quality products and reduce manual inspection costs. The project demonstrates skills in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), image preprocessing, computer vision, and transfer learning.

## Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect and preprocess images of products from the production line. Ensure the data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.

- **Data Sources:** Images of products, labeled with defect or no defect.
- **Techniques Used:** Image resizing, normalization, augmentation (e.g., rotation, flipping), splitting into training, validation, and test sets.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform EDA to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and visualize various aspects of the image data.

- **Techniques Used:** Image visualization, summary statistics, distribution analysis.

### 3. Model Building
Develop and evaluate CNN models to identify defects in products.

- **Techniques Used:** Building CNNs from scratch, transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50).

### 4. Model Training and Evaluation
Train the CNN models using the training data and evaluate their performance on validation and test sets.

- **Techniques Used:** Model training, hyperparameter tuning, performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).

### 5. Deployment
Deploy the trained model to a production environment for real-time defect detection.

- **Techniques Used:** Model saving, loading, and inference; integration with production line systems.
